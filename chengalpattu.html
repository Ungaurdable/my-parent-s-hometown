                            <p>Chengalpattu dates from the early Chola dynasty of the 2nd century BCE. Chengalpattu was
                                formerly
                                a capital of the kings of Vijayanagara, after their defeat by the Deccan sultanates at
                                Battle of
                                Talikota in 1565. The fortress at Chengalpattu, built by the Vijayanagara kings in the
                                16th
                                century, was of strategic importance, owing to its swampy surroundings and the lake that
                                flanked
                                its side. In 1639 a local governor or nayak, subject to these kings, granted a piece of
                                coastal
                                land to the British East India Company where Fort St George now stands, which became the
                                nucleus
                                of the city of Madras. Chengalpattu was taken by the French in 1751 and was retaken in
                                1752
                                by
                                Robert Clive, after which it proved of great strategic advantage to the British,
                                especially
                                when
                                Lally failed to capture the fortress in his advance on Madras. During the wars of the
                                British
                                with Hyder Ali of Mysore, it withstood his assault and afforded a refuge to the nearby
                                residents. In 1780, after the defeat of Colonel W Baillie, the army of Sir Hector Munro
                                took
                                refuge there. By 1900 the town was noted for its manufacture of pottery and was a local
                                market
                                center, especially of the rice trade. The surrounding district was home to cotton and
                                silk
                                weaving, indigo dyeing, tanneries, and a cigar factory, and extensive salt manufacturing

                                place along the coast.</p>
