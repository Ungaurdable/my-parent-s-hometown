                                <p>Chengalpattu dates from the early Chola dynasty of the 2nd century BCE. Chengalpattu
                                    was
                                    formerly
                                    a capital of the kings of Vijayanagara, after their defeat by the Deccan sultanates
                                    at
                                    Battle of
                                    Talikota in 1565. The fortress at Chengalpattu, built by the Vijayanagara kings in
                                    the
                                    16th
                                    century, was of strategic importance, owing to its swampy surroundings and the lake
                                    that
                                    flanked
                                    its side. In 1639 a local governor or nayak, subject to these kings, granted a piece
                                    of
                                    coastal
                                    land to the British East India Company where Fort St George now stands, which became
                                    the
                                    nucleus
                                    of the city of Madras. Chengalpattu was taken by the French in 1751 and was retaken
                                    in
                                    1752

                                    Robert Clive, after which it proved of great strategic advantage to the British,
                                    especially
                                    when
                                    Lally failed to capture the fortress in his advance on Madras. During the wars of

                                    refuge there. By 1900 the town was noted for its manufacture of pottery and was a
