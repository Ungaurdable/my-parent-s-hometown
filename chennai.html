                                    of Madras ended the war. By the 18th century, the British had conquered most of the
                                    region
                                    around Tamil Nadu and the northern modernâ€“day states of Andhra Pradesh and
                                    Karnataka,
                                    establishing the Madras Presidency with Madras as the capital.<br /><br />
                                    Gradually, the city grew into a major naval base and became the central

                                    century, the thriving urban centre was connected to other important cities such as
                                    Bombay
                                    and
                                    Calcutta, promoting increased communication and trade with the hinterland. Sir

                                    was
                                    Governor of Madras from 1906 to 1911 and promoted modern agriculture, industry,
                                    railways,
                                    education, the arts and more democratic governance. The Governor lived in Government

                                    was
                                    shelled by the German light cruiser SMS Emden on 22 September 1914, as it raided
                                    shipping
                                    lanes
                                    in the Indian Ocean, causing disruption to shipping.<br /><br />
                                    After India gained its independence in 1947, the city became the capital of Madras
                                    State,
                                    which
                                    was renamed as Tamil Nadu in 1969. The violent agitations of 1965 against the
                                    compulsory
                                    imposition of Hindi and in support of English in India in the state marked a major
                                    shift
                                    in
                                    the
                                    political dynamics of the city and eventually it had a big impact on the whole
                                    state.
                                    Because of
                                    Madras and its people, English was not abolished as an official language, and
                                    remains an
                                    official language of India alongside Hindi. On 17 July 1996, the city known as
                                    Madras
                                    was
                                    officially renamed Chennai, in line with what was then a nationwide trend to using
                                    less
                                    Anglicised names. On 26 December 2004, an Indian Ocean tsunami lashed the shores of
                                    Chennai,
                                    killing 206 people in Chennai and permanently altering the coastline. The 2015

                                <p class="float-start">Chennai is located on the southâ€“eastern coast of India in the
                                    northâ€“eastern part of Tamil Nadu on a flat coastal plain known as the Eastern
                                    Coastal
                                    Plains. Its average elevation is around 6.7 metres (22 ft), and its highest point is
                                    60
                                    m (200 ft). Chennai is 2,184 kilometres (1,357 mi) south of Delhi, 1,337 kilometres
                                    (831
                                    mi) southeast of Mumbai, and 345 kilometres (214 mi) east of Bangalore by road. Two
                                    major rivers flow through Chennai, the Cooum River (or Koovam) through the centre
                                    and
                                    the Adyar River to the south. A third river, the Kortalaiyar, travels through the
                                    northern fringes of the city before draining into the Bay of Bengal, at Ennore. The
                                    estuary of this river is heavily polluted with effluents released by the industries
                                    in
                                    the region. Adyar and Cooum rivers are heavily polluted with effluents and waste
                                    from
                                    domestic and commercial sources, the Coumm being so heavily polluted it is regarded
                                    as
                                    the city's eyesore. A protected estuary on the Adyar forms a natural habitat for
                                    several
                                    species of birds and animals. The Buckingham Canal, 4 km (2.5 mi) inland, runs
                                    parallel
                                    to the coast, linking the two rivers. The Otteri Nullah, an eastâ€“west stream, runs
                                    through north Chennai and meets the Buckingham Canal at Basin Bridge. Several lakes
                                    of
                                    varying size are located on the western fringes of the city. Some areas of the city
                                    have
                                    the problem of excess iron content in groundwater.<br /><br />
                                    Chennai's soil is mostly clay, shale and sandstone. Clay underlies most of the city,
                                    chiefly Manali, Kolathur, Maduravoyal, K. K. Nagar, Tambaram, Mudichur, Pallavaram
                                    Semmencherry, Alapakkam, Vyasarpadi and Anna Nagar. Sandy areas are found along the
                                    river banks and coasts, and include areas such as Tiruvottiyur, George Town,
                                    Madhavaram,
                                    New Washermanpet, Chepauk, Mylapore, Porur, Adyar, Besant Nagar and Uthandi. In

                                    areas, rainwater runoff percolates quickly through the soil. Areas having hard rock
                                    surface include Guindy, Nanganallur, Pallikaranai, Alandur, Jaladampet, Velachery,
                                    Adambakkam and a part of Saidapet and Perungudi. The ground water table in Chennai
                                    is at
                                    4-5m below ground in most of the areas, which was considerably improved and
                                    maintained
                                    through the mandatory rain water harvesting system. Of the 24.87 km coastline of the
                                    city, 3.08 km experiences erosion, with sand accretion along the shoreline can be
                                    noticed at the Marina beach and the area between the Ennore Port and Kosasthalaiyar
